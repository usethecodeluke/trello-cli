# Trello CLI

Built with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), and [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Typer is a framework built on Click, a popular CLI library for Python.  It adds web framework style conventions and a clean, structured programming paradigm, leveraging decorator syntax to make CLI development more readily maintainable.

Pydantic brings type validation to Python, and helps to ensure objects are consistently marshalled.  We use it in this case for env settings management as well.

Requests is a popular library for managing network requests and responses.

#TODO: Add sections on usage and configuration.
